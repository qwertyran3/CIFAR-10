# CIFAR-10
It is a multiclass image classification Task, where we are  provided with an image (of 32x32 pixel) and we need to label its class. Dataset consists of 60,000 images(6000 per class), i.e. a total of 10 classes. Used Convolution Neural Network and tried various optimization techniques to extract the features and a softmax classifier at the end for classification.
